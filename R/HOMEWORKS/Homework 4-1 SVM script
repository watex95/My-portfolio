# In this problem, you will use support vector approaches in order to predict
# whether a given car gets high or low gas mileage based on the Auto data set
# in the ISLR library.


# (a) Create a binary variable that takes on a 1 for cars with gas mileage
# above the median, and a 0 for cars with gas mileage below the median.



# (b) Fit a support vector classifier to the data with various values of cost,
# in order to predict whether a car gets high or low gas mileage. Report
# the cross-validated training dataset error associated with different
# values of this parameter. Comment on your results.



# (c) Now repeat (b), this time using SVMs with radial and polynomial basis
# kernels, with different values of gamma (sigma) and degree and cost.
# Comment on your results.

# This problem involves the OJ data set which is part of the ISLR package.
library(ISLR)
OJ=as.data.frame(OJ)

# (a) Create a training set containing a random sample of 60% of the observations,
# and a test set containing the remaining observations.



# (b) Fit a support vector classifier with a linear kernel to the training
# data using cost=0.01, with Purchase as the response and the other variables
# as predictors. Describe the results obtained.



# (c) What are the training and test error rates?



# (d) Use a tuning grid in caret to select an optimal cost. Consider values
# in the range 0.01 to 10.



# (e) Compute the training and test error rates using this new value for cost.



# (f) Repeat parts (b) through (e) using a support vector machine with a
# radial kernel. Use a grid of values for gamma but use default for cost


# (g) Repeat parts (b) through (e) using a support vector machine with a
# polynomial kernel.  Tune degree and cost using a grid.


# (h) Overall, which approach seems to give the best results on this data?
